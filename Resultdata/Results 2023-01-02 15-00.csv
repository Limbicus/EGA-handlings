Risk: Risk of collision, risk of injury to patient or operator, risk of damage to the system or other equipment.   Remedy: Ensure that movements are released only if neither the operator, the patient, other persons or other equipment cannot be endangered.   Always pay attention to possible collisions during movements.   Make sure that nobody is standing inside the danger area.   Ensure that collision sensors of the system are not covered by any accessories e.g. , drape fixtures,Â  which would unintentionally activate or prevent activation of the collision detection system.   Remove any objects from collision area, e.g.  injector or infusion stand.   Body penetrating objects introduced in the patient (e.g.  catheter, biopsy / kyphoplasty needle) must not be actuated by system movements.   Special care is required when the system has already detected a collision situation.   Use the emergency stop if required.

For the wireless hand control: Only if the hand control connection is lost with an activated e-stop by thisÂ control: After the connection loss, an activation and deactivation must take place at another emergency stop.   For the wired hand control: Only if the wired hand control functionality is lost with an activated e-stop by this control: Unplugging the wired hand control and thereafter activating and deactivating another emergency stop.   Note 1:Â The single actions of unplugging the wired hand controlÂ orÂ putting the wireless hand control in the drawer shall not deactivate the emergency stop.   IfÂ a connection is re-established and the e-stop has been released in the meanwhile at another device, the e-stop shall not be present.    If the e-stop has not been released in the meanwhile at another device, then the e-stop shall remain present until resolved.   Â Â Note 2: This is deemed to sufficiently prevent the scenario, that an e-stop is deactivated unintentionally when e.g. two operators activate their e-stops nearly simultaneously (followed by a deactivation of the second one), since it is deemed very unlikely that the sequence connection loss, and e-stop already is activated, another e-stop is activated for another purpose or unintentionally than to deactivate the e-stop in general.

There are statutory requirements governing the archiving period, data availability, and data security (data integrity), as well as recommendations concerning fire protection or water damage for the archiving of image data.    The operator of the archive is responsible for observing these regulations.   - Because of advances in technical development and statutory requirements, the storage of image data and access to it cannot be realized with a single storage and media technology alone.    Therefore, the migration of data may be necessary under the responsibility of the operator of the digital archive.

Possible consequences: Risk of death orÂ serious injury due to electric shock when electrified components are touched.   Remedy: Discharge the ESU immediately after removing main unit covers before starting to work on relevant parts of the main unit, especially when removing or working on the ESU itself.   If one of the fuses F21 or F20 is broken, the fast discharging procedure is not working.    Verify that no voltage on the fuse holder is present before replacing broken fuses!
